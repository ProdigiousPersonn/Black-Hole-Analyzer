# Black Hole Analyzer

## Overview
Black Hole Analyzer is a Python-based simulation that models gravitational time dilation, spacetime curvature, and gravitational redshift around black holes using the Schwarzschild metric from general relativity. The project demonstrates how time slows in stronger gravitational fields and visualizes these effects through computational methods. It serves as both an educational tool and a foundation for further study of relativistic physics using computer simulations.

## Methods
The simulation is implemented in Python and uses the Schwarzschild equations to calculate time dilation, redshift, and proper time for various black hole masses and distances. The code provides numerical and graphical outputs that show how different black hole sizes affect the passage of time and curvature of spacetime. Visualization components include 2D and 3D models, animations, and geodesic path simulations.
